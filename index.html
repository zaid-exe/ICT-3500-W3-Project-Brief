        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>Optimize Your PC is a user-friendly website designed to provide tools, tips, and resources for Windows PC users who want to improve the performance, security, and longevity of their computers. It offers guides on maintenance, troubleshooting, and software recommendations in a way that is approachable for beginners and helpful for intermediate users. The most important part of this whole idea is that every bit of information will be verified, vetted, and have sources.</p>

        <h2>Business Needs</h2>
        <p>Many PC users face performance slowdowns, cluttered systems, and confusion about safe optimization practices. This project addresses the need for a trusted source of information that bridges the gap between overly technical guides and vague troubleshooting advice. By offering clear, step-by-step content, the site helps users avoid costly repairs, unnecessary purchases, or potential security issues. This site serves as a resource for power users who want to maximize their system's capabilities.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>The primary goal is to empower users like myself and those with an interest in this hobby. Success from using this site properly comes in the form of post-optimized benchmarks of your system.</p>

        <h2>Competitor</h2>
        <p>The only competitors are local PC shops that know what they're doing. This hobby isn't about making money, but rather for PC power users who love this kind of thing. Open information, collaboration, and knowledge are essential for this hobby. That's why a community for this hobby has existed, and will continue to grow.</p>

        <h2>Risks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Content becoming outdated as technology evolves rapidly.</li>
          <li>Potential liability if third-party tools recommended later introduce issues.</li>
          <li>Difficulty maintaining consistent updates without a clear content management plan. To combat this, dating everything is MANDATORY.</li>
